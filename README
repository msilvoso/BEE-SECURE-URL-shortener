BEE-SECURE urlshortener

This was inspired by the project https://github.com/briancray/PHP-URL-Shortener by Brian Cray
The code was drastically changed in a way that would defeat the pedagogical purpose of the original project

Requirements for this project are:
- php > 5.3 (because of get_called_class in lib/db.php), with pdo
- mysql (can be adapted to any database)
- apache2 with mod_rewrite (could be adapted to any webserver with url rewrite functionnality)

Installation instructions:
- Install the database from the sql file in data/
- Change config.php to your needs
- Check the htaccess.public file for the apache configuration (documentroot is public/)
- I would recommend putting a http authentication on public/shorten/ (see htaccess.shorten)
